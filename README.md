# Heart-Disease-Patients-Classification
Logistic regression has performed better than Random Forest in terms of general accuracy and in cross validation. Both algorithms had an AUC of 0.95, which means that both models were able to differentiate between classes

# Heart Disease Patients Classification
Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of death in the US. It includes conditions that block or weak the vessels that carry blood-oxygen to the heart (coronary heart disease), as well as conditions that directly affect the cardiac muscle (i.e. congenital heart defects).

In this notebook I will compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest in predicting heart disease

# Conclusions :- 
Logistic regression has performed better than Random Forest in terms of general accuracy and in cross validation. Both algorithms had an AUC of 0.95, which means that both models were able to differentiate between classes.

  * The analysis showed some interesting insights:
  * high incidence of heart disease in women and younger people.
  * angina during exercise more common in healthy people.
  * normal results on the thallium and ecg tests as the most commonly associated with heart disease.
